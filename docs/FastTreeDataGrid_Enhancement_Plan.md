# FastTreeDataGrid Professional Feature Gap Analysis

## Snapshot Of The Current Implementation

- Core control surface lives in `src/FastTreeDataGrid.Control/Controls/FastTreeDataGrid.cs:41`–1299, exposing a single-selection, virtualized tree grid over a custom `IFastTreeDataGridSource`.
- Rendering and input are split between the presenter (`src/FastTreeDataGrid.Control/Controls/FastTreeDataGridPresenter.cs:14`–939) and a header presenter with resizing + single-column sort hooks (`src/FastTreeDataGrid.Control/Controls/FastTreeDataGridHeaderPresenter.cs:19`–520).
- Data access relies on application code constructing specialized sources such as the flat source used by the demo (`samples/FastTreeDataGrid.Demo/ViewModels/CountriesViewModel.cs:14`–132).

This foundation already covers virtualization, per-column widget factories, resize handles, and pointer-based expansion. The sections below highlight the largest missing pieces compared to mature commercial grids.

## High-Impact Gaps

### 1. Selection, Focus, And Keyboard Model
- Only a single index is tracked (`FastTreeDataGrid.cs:41`–76); there is no multi-row or cell selection API, no `SelectionChanged` event, and no support for range selection via Shift/Ctrl modifiers.
- Keyboard coverage still omits core patterns: expanding/collapsing via `Left/Right`, type-to-search, and sticky focus when the grid loses/gains focus.
- No way to keep focus at the cell layer (presenter only tracks row selection in `FastTreeDataGridPresenter.cs:112`–207).

### 2. Column Operations
- Column metadata supports resizing (`FastTreeDataGridColumn.cs:33`–122), but there is no column reordering, freezing/pinning, autosize-to-content, or column chooser UI.
- Sorting is limited to one column at a time (`FastTreeDataGrid.cs:774`–826). Professional grids usually offer multi-column sort with modifier keys and UI feedback.
- Lacks per-column filter menus or quick filter row.

### 3. Editing & Cell Templates
- The widget abstraction allows custom visuals, yet there is no editing lifecycle (enter/commit/cancel), validation surface, or editor templating based on the bound data type.
- No data annotations or IDataErrorInfo integration for validation feedback in cells.
- Keyboard navigation does not switch to edit mode, and presenter routing (`FastTreeDataGridPresenter.cs:305`–340) currently treats all cells as read-only.

### 4. Data Operations Beyond Flat Sorting
- Grouping/aggregation, totals rows, hierarchical summaries, and column-level aggregation are absent.
- Built-in filtering is missing; all filtering must be reinvented by each consumer (see the Countries demo filter code in `CountriesViewModel.cs:33`–109).
- No infrastructure for asynchronous refresh indicators (loading overlays, row placeholders) beyond the virtualization provider hooks.

### 5. Virtualization & Performance Options
- Row layout abstraction exists, but only a uniform implementation ships (`Infrastructure/FastTreeDataGridUniformRowLayout.cs:7`–73). Variable height rows, column virtualization, and container recycling pools are not provided.
- Scrolling to materialize large nodes is delegated to the app; there is no incremental expansion or "load more" affordance.

### 6. Accessibility & Automation
- There are no UI Automation peers or patterns, so screen readers cannot interact with the grid. This is essential for professional deployments.
- Keyboard focus cues and narrator hints are missing; presenter rendering (`FastTreeDataGridPresenter.cs:118`–219) does not expose focus rects or high-contrast styling hooks.

### 7. Styling, Theming, And Customization
- Styling is tied to the custom widget system, making it hard to use Avalonia `DataTemplates`.
- No theming story for high-contrast, touch input, or density changes; header/presenter colors are hard-coded (`FastTreeDataGridPresenter.cs:24`–39, `FastTreeDataGridHeaderPresenter.cs:24`–38).
- No localization of header context menus or tooltips because those surfaces do not exist yet.

### 8. Ecosystem Integration
- Lacks a straightforward `ItemsSource` overload that accepts `IEnumerable` + `HierarchicalDataTemplate`. Requiring an `IFastTreeDataGridSource` makes quick data binding harder.
- No design-time metadata or documentation around extending the virtualization provider pipeline.

## Proposed Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Selection & Keyboard Foundations
> Status: complete (extensible selection model, `SelectedIndices` binding, richer keyboard navigation, buffered type-to-search in place).
- [x] Introduce multi-selection state (`SelectedIndices`, `SelectionMode`) with change notifications.
- [x] Add range/anchor selection logic reacting to Shift/Ctrl modifiers in pointer and keyboard handlers.
- [x] Extend presenter keyboard routing to handle expand/collapse (`Left/Right`), type search, and selection focus cues.

### Phase 2 — Column UX Improvements
> Status: complete (drag reordering, pin left/right, auto-size actions, context menus, multi-column sorting shipped).
- [x] Implement drag-and-drop reordering in the header presenter.
- [x] Add column pinning (left/right freeze) and persist pinned state in layout computation.
- [x] Provide auto-size-to-content (measure visible rows, cache width) and per-column context menus with sort/pin sizing actions.
- [x] Upgrade sorting pipeline to accept multi-column sort descriptions (with visual indicators).
- [x] Expose `CellControlTemplate` so columns can host Avalonia controls via `IDataTemplate` (e.g., badges, progress bars).

### Phase 3 — Editing & Validation
> Status: complete (editing controller, templates, validation, and keyboard flows merged).
- [x] Introduce an editing controller layered over `FastTreeDataGridPresenter` that tracks edit scope per cell, raises `CellEditStarting/Committing/Canceled`, and funnels changes back to the active `IFastTreeDataGridSource`.
- [x] Extend `FastTreeDataGridColumn` with `EditTemplate`/`EditTemplateSelector` (Avalonia `IDataTemplate`) plus default primitives (text, checkbox, selector) so consumers can author editors without rewriting cell widgets.
- [x] Wire activation paths (F2, Enter, double-click, type-to-edit) and navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab, arrow keys while in edit) to transition between view/edit while preserving selection anchors and virtualization caches.
- [x] Surface validation by reflecting `IDataErrorInfo`/`INotifyDataErrorInfo` (and optional custom validators) onto cells with error glyphs, tooltip details, and accessibility announcements, including row-level aggregation when multiple cells fail.
- [x] Guard editing against virtualization churn: keep editors alive during scroll, add commit/cancel on row recycle, and ship regression tests (unit + interaction automation) covering edit lifecycle, validation feedback, and keyboard flows.

### Phase 4 — Data Operations & Analytics
- [x] Add grouping descriptors, group expand/collapse API, and summary rows.
- [x] Provide built-in filter row and column filter flyouts.
- [x] Offer aggregates/totals rows with extensible calculation callbacks.

### Phase 5 — Virtualization, Performance, And Async UX
- [x] Ship variable-height row layout and reuse pools for cell widgets.
- [x] Implement column virtualization for wide datasets.
- [x] Enhance async loading: skeleton rows, cancellation, progress indicators integrated with `FastTreeDataGridViewportScheduler`.

### Phase 6 — Accessibility & Theming
- [x] Implement Avalonia automation peers for the grid, rows, and cells.
- [x] Add focus rectangles, high-contrast resources, and keyboard narration hints.
- [x] Replace hard-coded colors with theme resources and document extensibility points.

### Phase 7 — Developer Experience
- [x] Provide adapters for `IEnumerable`/`HierarchicalDataTemplate` usage to lower entry cost.
- [x] Author comprehensive samples + docs for extending virtualization providers, editing, and selection.
- [x] Publish design-time metadata and analyzer hints for common misconfigurations.

Each phase builds on the existing architecture without forcing breaking changes, while closing the feature gap with enterprise-grade tree data grids.
